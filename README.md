# Origin Story

One of my daughters first 10 words was "type", because she would watch us work on the laptop.

When she was around 1 we gave her and old bluetooth keyboard to mash on. She proceeded to hack the iPad to play her favorite Mother Goose Club songs. It wasn't long before she began insisting on the real thing.

Occasionally we would appease her by doing Google image searches for her favorite things; trains, buses, cats. 

By 2 she was starting to be proficient at letter recognitation. 

I was sitting in a talk at OSCON 2018 when the idea struck. 

A toddler proof app that would let her search for images of her favorite things.
