# Origin Story

"Type" was in the first wave of words my daughter learned. She wanted to mimic mom and dad working on the laptop. She was so drawn to the concept, she would even say "type" when she saw a piano. 

Around 1, we gave her an old bluetooth keyboard to mash on. She proceeded to hack the iPad (which it wasn't paired with ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) to play her favorite Mother Goose Club songs. But by 1.5, she began insisting on the laptop.

I wasn't worried about the hardware on my 2011 MacBook Air. Naively I opened a text editor for her to type in. I was shocked at how many things could go wrong so quickly when a toddler starts pressing keys. I would leave it on the lock screen, but this got old fast. 
Occasionally we would appease her desire to use the laptop by doing Google image searches together, browsing her favorite things (trains, buses, cats). 

By 2 she was starting to be proficient at recognizing multiple letters in the alphabet. 

Against this backdrop, I was sitting in a talk on Rust at OSCON 2018 when the idea struck. 

A toddler proof game that would let her search for images of her favorite things.
